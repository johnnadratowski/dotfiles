# dotfiles

NOTE: This repo supports Mac only!  It could be fairly easily updated for Linux variants by adding a file for installing requirements replacing [brew_install.sh](brew_install.sh).  Some of the commands in aliases and functions in the `scripts` folder are mac specific too so you might be playing whack-a-mole with them.

To install: `./install.sh`

## Installation

- All files/dirs starting with `_(name)` get symlinked to `~/.(name)`.
- To explicitly symlink other objects, update [EXTRA_FILES](https://github.com/johnnadratowski/dotfiles/blob/master/install.py#L13) in [install.py](install.py).
- To explicitly create directories, update [DIRS](https://github.com/johnnadratowski/dotfiles/blob/master/install.py#L19) in [install.py](install.py).

## Shell

Uses [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) and [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

The shell startup is in [.zshrc](_zshrc) calling [.shellrc](_shellrc) which will run [~/scripts/init.sh](scripts/init.sh) and a `~/local-startup/init.sh` for
startup files that shouldn't be in git.

Supports vim mode, but also has emacs type bindings when you navigate.

### Prompt

Uses the [agkozak](https://github.com/agkozak/agkozak-zsh-prompt) prompt with git integration.

## Vim

Extensively configures vim (vimscript) and neovim:

- vim-plug
- Using netrw with vim-vinegar
- CoC
- Leaderf
- Custom [Molokai theme](https://github.com/johnnadratowski/molokai)
- startify

## Hammerspoon

Extensively uses Hammerspoon for Mac automation.  I use Karabiner to map
CapsLock to Shift+ctrl+option+cmd for all the tools keybindings.
The tools are either ran using a hotkey or they run in the toolbar.

The [init.lua](_hammerspoon/init.lua) is the entry points.
