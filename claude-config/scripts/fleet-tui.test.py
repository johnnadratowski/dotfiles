"""Headless tests for fleet_tui.py.  Run: uv run ~/.claude/scripts/fleet-tui.test.py

Hermetic: the fleet snapshot is stubbed and the ask files live in a temp dir, so nothing here
reads or writes the live fleet.

What it locks in — each is a way this view could lie or lose work:
  - a lane renders its status and its asks, and the asks are TYPED by their kind token
  - `x` removes the ask from the FILE, not merely from the screen
  - `u` puts it back — an accidental keypress on the user's to-do list must be recoverable
  - an unchanged snapshot does not rebuild the lists, so the cursor survives a refresh
